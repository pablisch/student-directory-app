# student-directory

This is a Makers' PreCourse Week 4 project.

The student directory script allows users to manage the list of students enrolled in the Villains Academy.
It is a simple app appropriate to the stage of l;earning that we are at but of little interest now.

## How to use

```bash
ruby directory_mk5.rb
```
You will be prompted to enter a filename to open or choose `d` for the default file `students.csv`.
